    <template #heading>Work Experience</template>

    I currently work as a TA for the Kahlert School of Computing. I'm currently assigned to CS2420, Introduction to Data
    Structures and Algorithms, which keeps me fresh on that set of critical skills. Just like my previous positions, this
    position primarily improves my skills in interpersonal communication, but with a focus on presenting or teaching during
    labs.

    <br>
    I worked for <a href="https://www.wasatchtutors.com/">Wasatch Tutors</a> in Sandy for my freshman year of college,
    working with high school students in both subject and ACT tutoring. This position boosted my experience in interpersonal
    communication and education. It is a great position and working there was a blast. This is a great position for anyone
    who wants to get into tutoring.

    Previously, I had worked at my local Walmart over the summer of 2021, and this was a great position to improve interpersonal communication and customer service skills.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before COVID-19, I had worked at my high school as a student math tutor, echoing much of the same experience
    I am gaining now. This was a free service provided to fellow students, and it was extremely enjoyable and
    rewarding.

    <template #heading>Development Experience</template>

    My experience dates back to 2018 during that initial software development course, where I first learned
    how to program with blocks, Javascript, and some C#. I am currently comfortable with many languages,
    including Python, C++, Java, and C#, all of which have been major parts of my high school and college curricula,
    as well as Rust and Javascript which I have tried to learn on the side.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have completed the Software Practice I course, demonstrating proficiency in C# as well as techniques
    relating to clear and effective software development. Unfortunately, in respect of keeping assignment solutions
    private, that code is not available.
    <br>
    <br>
    I try to post all of my projects publicly to Github whenever it is possible and appropriate to do so, and so
    that is where most of my public code resides. You can find a link to my Github under the Social Media tab, as
    well as a list of projects under the Projects tab.
