      A student at the <a href="https://www.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      I am a rising sophomore for an Honors Computer Science BS, with two minors in Math and Physics.
      I built this site both as a way to display my portfolio information, as well as practice
      legitimate web development techniques.
      <br>
      <br>
      I started developing software in 9th grade, when my junior high school established a new
      requirement that all students complete either a software development course, either in web or desktop
      development. I chose the desktop option, and immediately found a liking for the practice we
      completed in Javascript and C#. Throughout high school, I took every programming course that was
      offered, as well as an introductory game development course. I learned Python and C++, covering the
      basics of OOP and databases, as well as giving me concurrent enrollment credit which I am using
      to accelerate my current degree progress at the University of Utah. I have yet to reach many CS elective
      courses, but have interests in AI and Computer Graphics.
      <br>
      <br>
      Other than pure computing, I also own and maintain a 3D printer and participate in game design,
      especially through monthly game jams hosted by the Gamecraft club on campus. I try to find and participate
      in any events that I find particularly interesting. I currently work for Wasatch Tutors in Sandy.
