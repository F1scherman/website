I chose the desktop option, and immediately found a liking for the practice we completed in Javascript and C#. Throughout high school, I took every programming course that was offered, as well as an introductory game development course. I learned Python and C++, covering the basics of OOP and databases, as well as giving me concurrent enrollment credit which I am using to accelerate my current degree progress at the University of Utah. I have yet to reach many CS elective courses, but have interests in AI and Computer Graphics. <br data-v-cbbbe8f8><br data-v-cbbbe8f8> Other than pure computing, I also own and maintain a 3D printer and participate in game design, especially through monthly game jams hosted by the Gamecraft club on campus. I try to find and participate in any events that I find particularly interesting. I work as a TA for the KSoC, currently in CS2420: Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms. </h3>',2),u=[l];function _(s,r){return o(),n("div",b,u)}const m=a(p,[["render",_],["__scopeId","data-v-cbbbe8f8"]]);const f={class:"wrapper"},v={__name:"index",setup(s){return(r,y)=>(o(),n(i,null,[e(d),t("header",null,[t("div",f,[e(m)])])],64))}},g=a(v,[["__scopeId","data-v-96500f13"]]);h(g).mount("#app");
